### Hi there, I'm [Nathan](https://ncfrey.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal Machine Learning Scientist and Group Leader at [Prescient Design](https://github.com/prescient-design) â€¢ [Genentech](https://github.com/Genentech), where my group develops and applies ML methods for molecular discovery and design. Previously, I was a Postdoc at MIT with the Lincoln Lab Supercomputing and AI groups, working with Profs [Gomez-Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) and [Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/) on ML for materials and molecule design. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. I was a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow in the [Shenoy Group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) and an affiliate scientist at Berkeley Lab with the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on [generative modeling for proteins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12360) and [neural scaling of large language and geometric deep learning models](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/627bddd544bdd532395fb4b5)
