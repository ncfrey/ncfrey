### Hi there, I'm [Nathan](https://ncfrey.github.io/) 👋


I'm a Machine Learning Scientist and Group Leader at Prescient Design • Genentech, where I develop and apply ML methods for molecular discovery and design. Previously, I was a Postdoc at MIT with the Lincoln Lab Supercomputing and AI groups, working with Profs [Gomez-Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) and [Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/) on ML for materials and molecule design. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. I was a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow in the [Shenoy Group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) and an affiliate scientist at Berkeley Lab with the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about).

- 🔭 I’m working on [generative modeling for proteins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12360) and [neural scaling of large language and geometric deep learning models](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/627bddd544bdd532395fb4b5)
- 🧪 I contribute to democratizing deep learning for the life sciences with [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem)
- 🌱 I’m learning computational biology and antibody engineering
- ⚙️ I use `python`, `pytorch`, `pytorch-geometric`, 🤗, `aws`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `plotly`, and `bash`
