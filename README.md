### Hi there, I'm [Nathan](https://ncfrey.github.io/) 👋


I'm a Postdoc at MIT with the Lincoln Lab Supercomputing and AI groups. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I was a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow in the [Shenoy Group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) at the UPenn and an affiliate scientist at Berkeley Lab with the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about).

- 🔭 I’m working on democratizing deep learning for the life sciences with [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem)
- 🌱 I’m learning [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and 한국어 (Korean)
- ⚙️ I use `python`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `plotly`, and `bash` 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning for physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science
- 💬 Ask me about machine learning in applied science and engineering
